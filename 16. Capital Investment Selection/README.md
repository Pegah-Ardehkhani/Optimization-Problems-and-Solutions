**Problem Statement:**

The board of directors of General Wheels Co. is considering seven large capital investments. Each investment can be made only once. These investments differ in the estimated long-run profit (net present value) that they will generate as well as in the amount of capital required, as shown by the following table (in units of millions of dollars):

</p>

The total amount of capital available for these investments is  $100 million. Investment opportunities $1$ and $2$ are mutually exclusive, and so are $3$ and $4$. Furthermore, neither $3$ nor $4$ can be undertaken unless one of the first two opportunities is undertaken. There are no such restrictions on investment opportunities $5$, $6$, and $7$. The objective is to select the combination of capital investments that will maximize the total estimated long-run profit (net present value).
