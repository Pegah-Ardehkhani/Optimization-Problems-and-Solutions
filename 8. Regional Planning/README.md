**Problem Statement:**

The SOUTHERN CONFEDERATION OF KIBBUTZIM is a group of three kibbutzim (communal farming communities). Overall planning for this group is done in its Coordinating Technical Office. This office currently is planning agricultural production for the coming year.

The agricultural output of each kibbutz is limited by both the amount of available irrigable land and the quantity of water allocated for irrigation by the Water Commissioner (a national government official). These data are given in Table 3.8.
