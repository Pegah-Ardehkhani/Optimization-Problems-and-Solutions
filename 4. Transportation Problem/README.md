You are managing the distribution of goods from multiple suppliers to multiple consumers. Each supplier has a certain quantity of goods available for distribution, and each consumer has a certain demand for these goods. The goal is to determine the most cost-effective way to transport the goods from suppliers to consumers while minimizing transportation costs.

Details:

There are two suppliers: $S_1$ and $S_2$.

There are three consumers: $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$.

The cost of shipping one unit of goods from each supplier to each consumer is given as follows:

From $S_1$ to $C_1$: $3 per unit

From $S_1$ to $C_2$: $2 per unit

From $S_1$ to $C_3$: $7 per unit

From $S_2$ to $C_1$: $2 per unit

From $S_2$ to $C_2$: $5 per unit

From $S_2$ to $C_3$: $1 per unit

The supply available from each supplier is as follows:

$S_1$ has $10$ units available.
$S_2$ has $20$ units available.

The demand from each consumer is as follows:

$C_1$ requires $15$ units.

$C_2$ requires $10$ units.

$C_3$ requires $5$ units.

Your task is to determine how many units to ship from each supplier to each consumer to meet the demand while minimizing the total transportation cost. Use linear programming to find the optimal shipment quantities.
