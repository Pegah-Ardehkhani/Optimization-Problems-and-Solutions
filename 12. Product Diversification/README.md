The research and development division of a manufacturing company has developed
three possible new products. However, to avoid undue diversification of the company's product line, management has imposed the following restriction:

Restriction 1: From the three possible new products, at most two should be
chosen to be produced.

Two plants are available that could produce the chosen products. For administrative reasons, management has imposed a second restriction in this regard:

Restriction 2: Just one of the two plants should be chosen to produce the new
products.

The production cost per unit of each product would be essentially the same in the two plants. However, because of differences in their production facilities, the number of hours of production time needed per unit of each product might differ between the two plants. These data are given in Table 12.2, along with the total number of production hours available per week for these products in each plant, unit profit for each product, and marketing estimates of the number of units of each product that could be sold per week if it is produced. The objective is to choose the products, the plant, and the production rates of the chosen products so as to maximize the total profit.
