**Problem Statement:**

Consider a European farmer who specializes in raising wheat, corn, and sugar beets on his $500$ acres of land. 
During the winter, he wants to decide how much land to devote to each crop.

The farmer knows that at least $200\ T$ of wheat and $240\ T$ of corn are needed for cattle feed. 
These amounts can be raised on the farm or bought from a wholesaler. 
Any production in excess of the feeding requirement would be sold. Over the last decade, mean selling prices have been $170$ and $150$ per ton of wheat and corn, respectively. 
The purchase prices are $40\ \%$ more than this due to the wholesaler‚Äôs margin and transportation costs.

Another profitable crop is sugar beet, which he expects to sell at $36\ T$; however,the European Commission imposes a quota on sugar beet production. 
Any amountin excess of the quota can be sold only at $10\ T$. 
The farmer‚Äôs quota for next year is $6000\ T$.

Based on past experience, the farmer knows that the mean yield on his land is roughly $2.5\ T$, $3\ T$, and $20\ T$ per acre for wheat, corn, and sugar beets, respectively.

A first possibility is to assume some correlation among the yields of the different crops. 
A very simplified representation of this would be to assume that years are good, fair, or bad for all crops, resulting in above average, average, or below average yields for all crops. 
To fix these ideas, above and below average indicate a yield $20\ \%$ above or below the mean yield. For simplicity, we assume that weather conditions and yields for the farmer do not have a significant impact on prices.
