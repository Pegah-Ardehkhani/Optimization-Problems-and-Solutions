An airline needs to assign its crews to cover all its upcoming flights. We will focus on the problem of assigning three crews based in San Francisco (SF) to the flights listed in the first column of Table 12.4. The other 12 columns show the 12 feasible sequences of flights for a crew. (The numbers in each column indicate the order of the flights.) Exactly three of the sequences need to be chosen (one per crew) in such a way that every flight is covered. (It is permissible to have more than one crew on a flight, where the extra crews would fly as passengers, but union contracts require that the extra crews still be paid for their time as if they were working.) The cost of assigning a crew to a particular sequence of flights is given (in thousands of dollars) in the bottom row of the table. The objective is to minimize the total cost of the three crew assignments that cover all the flights.
