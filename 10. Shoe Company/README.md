**Problem Statement:**

You have a company of shoes with $3$ large machines, and you wish to minimize the total cost of production.

The total cost of production of each machine is a function of production:

$C_A=0.1P_A^2+0.5P_A+0.1$

$C_B=0.3P_B+0.5$

$C_C=0.01P_C^3$

Where $C$ is the cost of production of $P$ product for each machine.

In the next month, you have a demand of $10,000$ shoes. What is the number of products that should be assigned to each machine in order to minimize the total cost?
