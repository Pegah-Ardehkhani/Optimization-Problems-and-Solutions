**Problem Statement:**

A manufacturing firm has discontinued the production of a certain unprofitable product line. This act created considerable excess production capacity. Management is considering devoting this excess capacity to one or more of three products; call them products $1$, $2$, and $3$. The available capacity on the machines that might limit output is summarized in the following table:

</p>

The number of machine hours required for each unit of the respective products is as follows:

</p>

The sales department indicates that the sales potential for products $1$ and $2$ exceeds the maximum production rate and that the sales potential for product $3$ is $20$ units per week. The unit profit would be $50$, $20$, and $25$, respectively, on products $1$, $2$, and $3$. The objective is to determine how much of each product the firm should produce to maximize profit.

Formulate a linear programming model for this problem.
