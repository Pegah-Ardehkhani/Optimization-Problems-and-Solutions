Given a set of cities and the distance between every pair of cities, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

Suppose we have 4 cities: A, B, C, and D, with the following distances (in arbitrary units):

â€¢	Distance from A to B: 10

â€¢	Distance from A to C: 15

â€¢	Distance from A to D: 20

â€¢	Distance from B to C: 35

â€¢	Distance from B to D: 25

â€¢	Distance from C to D: 30

We want to find the shortest tour that starts at one of the cities, visits each city exactly once, and returns to the starting city.
